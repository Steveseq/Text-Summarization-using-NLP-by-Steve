# Text-Summarization-using-NLP-by-Steve
A text summarization project using NLP where we use  and import libraries such as spaCy, heapq, stop__WORDS to summarize text using extractive feature technique. A GUI will open to click summarize text where user has to manually put the paragraph in order to have a  summary. The algorithm we use here is text rank algorithm.
